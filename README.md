This is the official repository for "Towards Foundational AI Models in Additive Manufacturing: Evaluating Large Language Models for G-Code Debugging, Manipulation, and Comprehension". This repo contains all results that were generated as part of our experimentation - G-code, markdown file for chats, chat screenshots, and an overview of our prompts.

Results are split into two categories - raw and processed.

`raw` contains raw output from the model, and are not processed in any way. These results are stored in the `raw` folder.

**Outputs for more models soon!**

Notes:
- There maybe spelling errors in some input prompts.
- We highlight "User" and "Model name" for easy viewing.
- We add backticks to all G-codes (input) for easy viewing. Backticks in outputs are generated by respective models.
- In some cases, missing backticks were added to the end of the ChatGPT responses to make it easier to read.
- Minor differences in codeblock formatting are generated by the model, and are not manually added.
