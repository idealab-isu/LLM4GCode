use these definitions to understand the gcode i'm about to send. For context, I have provided example commands for a 3d printer.
M104 S205 sets nozzle temperature to 205 degrees Celsius
G28 homes all axes
G1 Z5 F5000 moves the Z axis up 5mm at a speed of 5000mm/min
M109 S200 sets bed temperature to 200 degrees Celsius
G21 sets all units to millimeters
G90 uses absolute coordinates
M82 uses absolute distance for extrusion
G92 E0 sets extrusion to 0
M107 turns off the fan
M106 S255 turns on the fan at full speed. S128 would turn it on at half speed
G1 X90 Y90 F7800 moves the print head in X and Y to 90mm at a speed of 7800mm/min
G1 E2 F2400 extrudes 2mm of filament at a speed of 2400mm/min
G1 F1800 sets the feedrate to 1800mm/min

The G-Code you've sent is used by 3D Printers to control their movement and actions during printing. Here's an explanation of each command:

M104 S205: This command tells the printer's heater unit to set its target temperature to 205°C (399°F) for the nozzle. The "S" parameter specifies which heaters are being controlled ("T" for the bed and "P" for the nozzle).
G28: This command tells the printer to move the printhead back to the origin (usually the center of the build plate), and homing all three axes.
G1 Z5 F5000: This command tells the printer to move the printhead upwards by 5 mm at a feed rate of 5000 mm per minute. The "Z" parameter indicates that we're moving along the vertical axis, while the "F" parameter specifies the feed rate.
M109 S200: This command tells the printer's heating element to start warming up to 200°C (392°F) for the bed. Again, the "S" parameter controls which heater elements should be adjusted.
G21: This command informs the printer that we'll be using metric units instead of imperial ones.
G90: This command enables absolute positioning, meaning that all future movements will refer to an absolute location rather than a relative one.
M82: This command activates the Extruder Hotend, allowing it to melt and deposit plastic material.
G92 E0: This command resets the current extrusion counter to zero. It's important to reset this value before every print job so that the correct amount of material can be dispensed.
M107: This command instructs the printer's cooling fans to stop spinning.
M106 S255: This command instructs the printer's cooling fans to start spinning at full speed (255 RPM). You can adjust the speed with the second parameter (S128 for half speed, etc.).
G1 X90 Y90 F7800: This command moves the printhead to the specified coordinates (X = 90 mm; Y = 90 mm) at a feed rate of 7800 mm per minute.
G1 E2 F2400: This command tells the printer to extrude two millimeters of filament at a feed rate of 2400 mm per minute. The "E" parameter specifies the length of the extrusion.
G1 F1800: This command sets the overall feed rate for the entire print job to 1800 mm per minute. After sending this command, any subsequent movements or extrusions will occur at this default speed until another feed rate is explicitly defined.

This code looks like it might belong to a 3D printed object designed specifically to test the functionality of the Ultimaker 3D printer controller board.

It starts by setting the nozzle temperature to 200 °C (392 °F) using M104 S200. Then, it sends the G28 command, which means “home” or return to the original position. Next, it lifts the nozzle fivemillimeters (G1 Z5), then increases the feed rate to 5000 mm/min(F5000) for the next few lines.

```
G1 Z5 F5000
M109 S200
G21
G90
M82
G92 E0
```

These four lines tell the printer’s firmware to enable absolute coordinates(G90), switch to millimeter mode(G21), disable automatic retraction(M82),reset the extruder count(G92 E0),and activate the hot end(M104 S[temperature]).

```
M107
G1 X90 Y90 F7800
G1 E2 F2400
```

Next,the printer waits for the bed to reach the desired temperature (set with M109 S[temp])before starting the print.(M107). Then,it moves the printhead to x=90 y=90 mm at a feed rateof 7800 mm/min(G1 X90 Y90 F7800).After that, it extrudes two millimeters of filament at a feed rate of 2400 mm/min(G1 E2 F2400).Finally, the printer sets the overall feed rate for the entireprint job to 1800 mm/min(G1 F1800).

Great, now I'd like you to produce a rotated version of the g-code shape I gave you and give me the g-code for this shape. I'd like to do a 45 degree counter clockwise rotation along the z axis

Here is the same code but after rotating the model 45 degrees around the Z-axis:
