use these definitions to understand the gcode i'm about to send. For context, I have provided example commands for a 3d printer.
M104 S205 sets nozzle temperature to 205 degrees Celsius
G28 homes all axes
G1 Z5 F5000 moves the Z axis up 5mm at a speed of 5000mm/min
M109 S200 sets bed temperature to 200 degrees Celsius
G21 sets all units to millimeters
G90 uses absolute coordinates
M82 uses absolute distance for extrusion
G92 E0 sets extrusion to 0
M107 turns off the fan
M106 S255 turns on the fan at full speed. S128 would turn it on at half speed
G1 X90 Y90 F7800 moves the print head in X and Y to 90mm at a speed of 7800mm/min
G1 E2 F2400 extrudes 2mm of filament at a speed of 2400mm/min
G1 F1800 sets the feedrate to 1800mm/min

**ChatGPT**

Alright, I understand the definitions. Please provide the G-code sequence you'd like me to interpret.

Okay, let's break down the provided G-code sequence:


1. **M104 S200** ; set temperature

    - Set nozzle temperature to 200°C, but doesn't wait for the temperature to reach that point before continuing.

2. **G28** ; home all axes

    - Homes all the axes, ensuring that the print starts from a known position.

3. **G1 Z5 F5000** ; lift nozzle

    - Lifts the nozzle up by 5mm at a speed of 5000mm/min.

4. **M109 S200** ; set temperature and wait for it to be reached

    - Sets the bed temperature to 200°C and waits until the temperature is achieved before proceeding.

5. **G21** ; set units to millimeters

    - Ensures all measurements are in millimeters.

6. **G90** ; use absolute coordinates

    - Commands given after this will be in terms of absolute position on the build platform.

7. **M82** ; use absolute distances for extrusion

    - The extrusion distances are also given in absolute terms.

8. **G92 E0**

    - Resets the extrusion distance to zero.

9. **M107**

    - Turns off the fan.

10. **G1 Z.35 F7800**

    - Lifts the nozzle to 0.35mm above the bed at a speed of 7800mm/min.

11. **G1 E-2 F2400**

    - Retracts 2mm of filament at a speed of 2400mm/min. This prevents oozing as the nozzle moves.

12. **G92 E0**

    - Resets the extrusion distance to zero again.

13. **G1 X102.825 Y102.825 F7800**

    - Moves the print head to X=102.825mm, Y=102.825mm at a speed of 7800mm/min without extruding.

14. **G1 E2 F2400**

    - Extrudes 2mm of filament at 2400mm/min, priming the nozzle for the next printing action.

The following lines:

- Moves the nozzle around the build platform.
- Extrudes or retracts filament as needed.
- Sets different feed rates for different operations.

The "TYPE" comments (e.g., ";TYPE:External perimeter", ";TYPE:Solid infill") indicate the type of the operation being performed. These comments are for human readability and have no effect on the printer's behavior.

The sequence ends with a series of extrusions and retractions while moving the print head to various positions to create the desired 3D object layer. If you wanted a visual representation, you would need to use a G-code viewer tool that can show you a graphical representation of this code.

Great, now I'd like you to produce a rotated version of the g-code shape I gave you and give me the g-code for this shape. I'd like to do a 45 degree counter clockwise along the z axis

**ChatGPT**

To rotate the G-code shape by 45 degrees counter-clockwise around the Z-axis, we need to apply a rotation transformation to the X and Y coordinates in the G-code.

The transformation formula to rotate a point (X, Y) about the origin (0, 0) counter-clockwise by θ degrees is:

$X'=X \times cos(\theta) - Y \times sin(\theta)$

$Y'=X \times sin(\theta) + Y \times cos(\theta)$


For a 45 degree rotation counter-clockwise:

$cos(45\degree)=\sqrt{2}/2$

$sin(45\degree)=\sqrt{2}/2$

Applying the formulas:

$X'=(\sqrt{2}/2) X - (\sqrt{2}/2) Y$

$Y'=(\sqrt{2}/2) X + (\sqrt{2}/2) Y$


Let's apply this transformation to the provided G-code:

Note: I will only transform the lines with X and Y movements and leave other commands unchanged.

The G-code provided above is a 45-degree counter-clockwise rotation of your original shape around the Z-axis. Make sure to visualize and check this G-code in a simulator or viewer before printing, to ensure it results in the desired shape.
