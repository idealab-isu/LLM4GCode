use these definitions to understand the gcode i'm about to send. For context, I have provided example commands for a 3d printer.
M104 S205 sets nozzle temperature to 205 degrees Celsius
G28 homes all axes
G1 Z5 F5000 moves the Z axis up 5mm at a speed of 5000mm/min
M109 S200 sets bed temperature to 200 degrees Celsius
G21 sets all units to millimeters
G90 uses absolute coordinates
M82 uses absolute distance for extrusion
G92 E0 sets extrusion to 0
M107 turns off the fan
M106 S255 turns on the fan at full speed. S128 would turn it on at half speed
G1 X90 Y90 F7800 moves the print head in X and Y to 90mm at a speed of 7800mm/min
G1 E2 F2400 extrudes 2mm of filament at a speed of 2400mm/min
G1 F1800 sets the feedrate to 1800mm/min

Sure! Based on the definitions you provided, here's how I understand the G-code instructions you listed:

**User**

M104 S205 sets the nozzle temperature to 205°C.
G28 homes all axes, which means it sends the print head to its home position.
G1 Z5 F5000 moves the Z axis up 5mm at a speed of 5000mm/min. The "G1" command specifies that this is a linear move, and the "Z5" parameter tells the printer to move the Z axis by 5mm. The "F5000" parameter sets the feed rate (speed) of the move to 5000mm/min.
M109 S200 sets the bed temperature to 200°C.
G21 sets all units to millimeters. This tells the printer to use millimeters as the unit of measurement for any subsequent movements or distances specified in the G-code program.
G90 uses absolute coordinates. This tells the printer to use absolute coordinates (i.e., the current position of the print head) rather than relative coordinates (i.e., moving a certain distance from the current position).
M82 uses absolute distance for extrusion. This tells the printer to use an absolute distance (i.e., a specific length of filament) for extrusion, rather than a relative amount (i.e., extruding a certain amount based on the current flow rate).
G92 E0 sets extrusion to 0. The "G92" command specifies that this is an extrusion command, and the "E0" parameter sets the extrusion amount to 0 (i.e., stop extruding).
M107 turns off the fan.
M106 S255 turns on the fan at full speed. The "M106" command specifies that this is a fan control command, and the "S255" parameter sets the fan speed to 255 (i.e., maximum speed). You mentioned that S128 would turn the fan on at half speed, so S255 must be the maximum speed.
G1 X90 Y90 F7800 moves the print head in X and Y to 90mm at a speed of 7800mm/min. The "G1" command specifies that this is a linear move, and the "X90 Y90" parameters tell the printer to move the print head to the XY coordinate (90, 90) mm. The "F7800" parameter sets the feed rate (speed) of the move to 7800mm/min.
G1 E2 F2400 extrudes 2mm of filament at a speed of 2400mm/min. The "G1" command specifies that this is a linear move, and the "E2" parameter tells the printer to perform an extrusion move. The "F2400" parameter sets the feed rate (speed) of the extrusion to 2400mm/min.
G1 F1800 sets the feedrate to 1800mm/min. The "G1" command specifies that this is a linear move, and the "F1800" parameter sets the feed rate (speed) of the move to 1800mm/min.

This G-code file appears to be a 3D printing file for an object with several different layers. Here's a breakdown of the code:

M104 S200 - Set the temperature of the hotend to 200°C.
G28 - Home all axes.
G1 Z5 F5000 - Lift the nozzle by 5mm.
M109 S200 - Wait for the temperature to reach 200°C.
G21 - Set the unit of measurement

**User**

Great, now I'd like you to produce a rotated version of the g-code shape I gave you and give me the g-code for this shape. I'd like to do a 45 degree counter clockwise rotation along the z axis

**Llama**

Sure! To rotate the shape 45 degrees counterclockwise along the Z axis, we can use the G21 command (which sets the unit of measurement to millimeters) followed by the G40 command (which specifies a linear interpolation move). The syntax for the G40 command is as follows:

G40 X<x_position> Y<y_position> Z<z_position> A<angle_degrees>
Where <x_position> represents the new x position after rotation, <y_position> represents the new y position after rotation, <z_position> represents the new z position after rotation, and <angle_degrees> represents the angle of rotation in degrees.

Here's the modified g-code that includes the rotation command:
