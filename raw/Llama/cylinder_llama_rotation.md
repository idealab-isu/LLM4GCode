use these definitions to understand the gcode i'm about to send. For context, I have provided example commands for a 3d printer.
M104 S205 sets nozzle temperature to 205 degrees Celsius
G28 homes all axes
G1 Z5 F5000 moves the Z axis up 5mm at a speed of 5000mm/min
M109 S200 sets bed temperature to 200 degrees Celsius
G21 sets all units to millimeters
G90 uses absolute coordinates
M82 uses absolute distance for extrusion
G92 E0 sets extrusion to 0
M107 turns off the fan
M106 S255 turns on the fan at full speed. S128 would turn it on at half speed
G1 X90 Y90 F7800 moves the print head in X and Y to 90mm at a speed of 7800mm/min
G1 E2 F2400 extrudes 2mm of filament at a speed of 2400mm/min
G1 F1800 sets the feedrate to 1800mm/min

Sure! Based on the definitions you provided, here's how I understand the G-code instructions you listed:

M104 S205 sets the nozzle temperature to 205°C.
G28 homes all axes, which means it sends the print head to its home position (the origin) along all three axes (X, Y, and Z).
G1 Z5 F5000 moves the Z axis up 5mm at a speed of 5000mm/min. The "G1" command specifies that this is a linear move, and the "Z5" parameter tells us that it's moving along the Z axis. The "F5000" parameter gives the feed rate (speed) of the move, which is 5000 mm/min.
M109 S200 sets the bed temperature to 200°C.
G21 sets all units to millimeters. This tells the printer that from now on, any coordinate values specified in the G-code will be in millimeters rather than inches or other units.
G90 uses absolute coordinates. This means that when we specify coordinates in the G-code, they will be interpreted as absolute positions relative to the machine's home position, rather than relative to the current position.
M82 uses absolute distance for extrusion. This tells the printer to use an absolute value for the amount of filament to extrude, rather than a relative value.
G92 E0 sets extrusion to 0. The "G92" command controls the extrusion rate, and setting it to "E0" tells the printer not to extrude any filament.
M107 turns off the fan.
M106 S255 turns on the fan at full speed. Setting the "S" parameter to "255" tells the printer to run the fan at maximum speed. If we wanted to set the fan speed to half, we could change the "S" parameter to "128".
G1 X90 Y90 F7800 moves the print head in X and Y to 90mm at a speed of 7800mm/min. Like before, the "G1" command indicates a linear move, and the "X90 Y90" parameters tell us that we want to move the print head to the XY plane position (90, 90) mm. The "F7800" parameter gives the feed rate of the move, which is 7800 mm/min.
G1 E2 F2400 extrudes 2mm of filament at a speed of 2400mm/min. The "G1" command again indicates a linear move, but this time the "E2" parameter tells us that we want to extrude filament while moving. The "F2400" parameter gives the feed rate of the extrusion, which is 2400 mm/min.
G1 F1800 sets the feedrate to 1800mm/min. This sets the default feed rate for future moves, so that if we don't specify a feed rate explicitly, the printer will use 1800 mm/min instead.

The provided list of G-code commands appears to be a sequence of moves for a CNC machine, specifically a milling machine. Here's a breakdown of the commands:

G1: This is the most common command in the list and stands for "rapid positioning" or "move quickly". It tells the machine to move rapidly to the specified location without turning on any cutting tools.
X followed by a number: These are coordinates that specify the destination point for the rapid movement commanded by the G1 code. For example, X98.75 means move the spindle to the coordinate (98.75,0) in the XY plane.
Y followed by a number: These are coordinates that specify the destination point for the rapid movement commanded by the G1 code. For example, Y94.623 means move the spindle to the coordinate (0,94.623) in the XY plane.
E followed by a number: These are feed rates that control how fast the machine moves during the rapid positioning commanded by the G1 code. For example, E5.53507 means move at a feed rate of 5.53507 units per minute.
The remaining commands in the list, such as G1 X105.161 Y101.951 E6.55283, can be broken down similarly. They consist of a combination of G1 (rapid positioning), X and Y coordinates (destination points), and E feed rates (speed of movement).

In summary, this list of G-code commands instructs a CNC milling machine to perform a series of rapid movements to specific locations in the XY plane, with varying feed rates.

Great, now I'd like you to produce a rotated version of the g-code shape I gave you and give me the g-code for this shape. I'd like to do a 45 degree counter clockwise rotation along the z axis
Sure! To rotate the shape 45 degrees counterclockwise along the Z axis, we can use the R command in G-code. The R command specifies a rotation about an axis, and we can use the Z axis as the rotation axis.

**Llama**

Here's the rotated version of the shape you provided, with the G-code commands for each line:

```
(0,0)
G1 X100 Y100 E10.0
G1 X100 Y105 E10.0
G1 X105 Y105 E10.0
G1 X105 Y100 E10.0
G1 X100 Y100 E10.0

(45 deg CCW)
G1 R45 Z
G1 X100 Y100 E10.0
G1 X100 Y105 E10.0
G1 X105 Y105 E10.0
G1 X105 Y100 E10.0
G1 X100 Y100 E10.0
Note that the R45 command specifies a 45 degree rotation counterclockwise about the Z axis. We could also have used R-45 to specify a 45 degree rotation clockwise about the Z axis instead.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Can you give me a full g-code output? I want to have something I can copy paste into a g-code renderer?
Sure! Here's a complete g-code program that includes the rotated shape you requested:

; Program start
G90                       ; Absolute mode
G21                       ; Units in mm
G1 R45 Z                ; Rotate 45 degrees counterclockwise about Z axis
G1 X100 Y100 E10.0     ; Move to (100,100) at 10mm/min
G1 X100 Y105 E10.0     ; Move to (100,105) at 10mm/min
G1 X105 Y105 E10.0     ; Move to (105,105) at 10mm/min
G1 X105 Y100 E10.0     ; Move to (105,100) at 10mm/min
G1 X100 Y100 E10.0     ; Move to (100,100) at 10mm/min

; Program end
M30                       ; End program
```

This program starts by setting absolute mode (G90) and specifying that units should be in millimeters (G21). Then it rotates the shape 45 degrees counterclockwise about the Z axis using the R45 command. Finally, it moves to the four corners of the shape using the G1 command, which specifies rapid positioning, and the X and Y coordinates specify the destination points. The E value sets the feed rate to 10mm/min.

You can copy and paste this code into a G-code renderer or simulator to see the motion of the machine tool as it executes the program. Note that this code assumes that the machine tool has a spindle speed of 10000 rpm, so you may need to adjust the feed rates accordingly depending on your machine's capabilities.
