use these definitions to understand the gcode i'm about to send. For context, I have provided example commands for a 3d printer.
M104 S205 sets nozzle temperature to 205 degrees Celsius
G28 homes all axes
G1 Z5 F5000 moves the Z axis up 5mm at a speed of 5000mm/min
M109 S200 sets bed temperature to 200 degrees Celsius
G21 sets all units to millimeters
G90 uses absolute coordinates
M82 uses absolute distance for extrusion
G92 E0 sets extrusion to 0
M107 turns off the fan
M106 S255 turns on the fan at full speed. S128 would turn it on at half speed
G1 X90 Y90 F7800 moves the print head in X and Y to 90mm at a speed of 7800mm/min
G1 E2 F2400 extrudes 2mm of filament at a speed of 2400mm/min
G1 F1800 sets the feedrate to 1800mm/min

**ChatGPT**

Sure, I'll help you understand the G-code commands you've provided using the provided definitions:

1. **M104 S205**: This command sets the nozzle temperature to 205 degrees Celsius. It's used to heat up the printer's extruder nozzle to the specified temperature.

2. **G28**: This command homes all axes. Homing refers to the process of moving each axis (X, Y, and Z) to its predefined "home" position, which is usually the printer's starting reference point.

3. **G1 Z5 F5000**: This command moves the Z axis up 5mm at a speed of 5000mm/min. It's instructing the printer to move the build platform (or nozzle) vertically by 5mm at a rapid speed of 5000mm/min.

4. **M109 S200**: This command sets the bed temperature to 200 degrees Celsius. Similar to M104, but this sets the temperature for the print bed.

5. **G21**: This command sets all units to millimeters. It ensures that all subsequent position and movement commands will be interpreted in millimeters.

6. **G90**: This command switches to using absolute coordinates. In absolute coordinate mode, the positions specified in the G-code are treated as specific positions in the printer's coordinate system.

7. **M82**: This command sets the extrusion mode to absolute distance. When in this mode, the extruder's movements are determined by the specific amount of filament to be extruded, rather than the relative movement.

8. **G92 E0**: This command sets the extrusion value to 0. It's used to reset the extruder's position reference, often used to ensure that the extruder starts from a known position.

9. **M107**: This command turns off the fan. Fans are often used to cool down the printed material, and this command disables the fan.

10. **M106 S255**: This command turns on the fan at full speed (255 being the maximum value). You mentioned that using S128 would turn it on at half speed.

11. **G1 X90 Y90 F7800**: This command moves the print head to X and Y coordinates of 90mm at a speed of 7800mm/min. It's a rapid movement in the X and Y directions.

12. **G1 E2 F2400**: This command extrudes 2mm of filament at a speed of 2400mm/min. It's instructing the printer to push out 2mm of filament from the extruder at the specified speed.

13. **G1 F1800**: This command sets the feedrate (movement speed) to 1800mm/min. Subsequent movement commands will be executed at this speed until a new feedrate is specified.

Feel free to provide the G-code you want me to analyze, or ask any further questions about specific commands!

... and so on. The code continues with more movement and extrusion commands, specifying different coordinates and filament extrusion amounts.

Each G-code command instructs the 3D printer on a specific action, such as moving the print head, extruding filament, setting temperatures, and more, enabling the printer to create a 3D object layer by layer.

Great, now I'd like you to produce a rotated version of the g-code shape I gave you and give me the g-code for this shape. I'd like to do a 45 degree counter clockwise rotation along the z axis

Rotating G-code requires transforming the coordinates of each point while maintaining the extrusion commands. Here's a version of the provided G-code snippet with a 45-degree counterclockwise rotation along the Z-axis:

Note: In this rotated G-code, I've adjusted the X and Y coordinates of each movement command based on a 45-degree counterclockwise rotation around the Z-axis. The calculations for these adjustments involve trigonometric functions to apply the rotation matrix. Keep in mind that this process might introduce rounding errors, and some commands might need further adjustments based on the specifics of your printer and its coordinate system. Always test the generated G-code on a non-critical print to ensure proper functionality.
